                <b>HTML</b> stands for <b> Markup Language</b>. It is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web.
             <ul>
                <li> HTML is a markup language, not a programming language, meaning it annotates text to define how it is structured and displayed by web browsers.</li>
                 <li>It forms the building blocks of all websites and is complemented by CSS for style and JavaScript for interactivity.
                    In a nutshell, HTML is all about organizing and displaying information on a webpage. We can think of it as the bones or structure of a webpage.</li>
